    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>We have decided to make an educational web application platform for students to interact and meet with other students that are in similar classes as them. This is of utmost importance during this time because virtual learning prevents students from meeting their peers, making new friends, and collaborating with others for the class.</p>
    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>Our application will let students meet new people by telling a new user to enter their schedule which then is saved into a database. Whenever a new user joins, their schedule is then compared to the other schedules in the database which then returns with a list of students that have similar classes to the user. This allows the user to meet other students and make friends with also the feature to collaborate through a messaging system. Furthermore, the platform is able to show studentsâ€™ majors and hobbies in order to let students make friends who have the same hobbies or majors.</p>
    <h3>How and Where?</h3>
    <p>As of at the moment it is still a developing and work in progress application. It is being run locally and the source code to run this application can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tkudupudi2/CMPE-133"><em>our github</em></a>.</p>
